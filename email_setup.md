>>>>>how to setup email on magento 2 admin ?

Setting up email configuration in Magento 2's admin panel involves configuring the email server settings so that Magento can send transactional emails, order notifications, and other email communications. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up email in the Magento 2 admin panel:

**Step 1: Log in to Magento Admin Panel**

Log in to your Magento 2 Admin Panel using your administrator credentials.

**Step 2: Access Email Configuration**

1. In the Magento Admin Panel, go to `Stores > Configuration`.

2. Under the "General" section in the left sidebar, click on "Advanced" and then select "System."

3. In the "Mail Sending Settings" section, you will see the following options:

   - **Enable:** Set this option to "Yes" to enable email communication.

   - **Host:** Enter the SMTP server hostname or IP address provided by your email service provider.

   - **Port:** Specify the SMTP server port number. The default for secure connections is 465, and for non-secure connections, it's 25.

   - **Authentication:** Set this to "Login" if your SMTP server requires authentication.

   - **Username:** Enter the username for SMTP authentication.

   - **Password:** Enter the password for SMTP authentication.

   - **Encryption:** Choose the type of encryption to use. Options typically include "SSL" or "TLS" for secure connections or "None" for non-secure connections.

   - **Sender Name:** Specify the sender's name for outgoing emails.

   - **Sender Email:** Enter the sender's email address.

   - **Test Email Recipient:** If you want to test the email settings, enter an email address here.

**Step 3: Save Configuration**

After filling out the necessary email settings, click the "Save Config" button at the top right corner to save the configuration.

**Step 4: Test Email Settings (Optional)**

To test if the email configuration is working correctly:

1. Go to `System > Tools > All Settings`.

2. Under "Default Config," expand "Advanced" and click on "System."

3. In the "Mail Sending Settings" section, click the "Run Self Test" button.

Magento will attempt to send a test email to the address specified in the "Test Email Recipient" field. Check your email inbox to confirm if you receive the test email.

**Step 5: Verify Email Sending**

To ensure that your email settings are correctly configured, create and complete a test order on your Magento store. If email notifications, such as order confirmation emails or customer registration emails, are sent successfully, it indicates that your email setup is working as expected.

That's it! You've set up email configuration in the Magento 2 admin panel. Your store should now be able to send transactional emails using the specified SMTP server settings.
